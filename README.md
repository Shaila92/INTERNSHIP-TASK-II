# INTERNSHIP-TASK-II

Objective: Analyze the dataset to find patterns, correlations, and anomalies.
Tasks:  ○ Perform descriptive statistics on numerical and categorical features. ○ Use visualization tools like matplotlib and seaborn to create histograms, pair plots, and heatmaps. ○ Identify missing values, outliers, and imbalances.



Deliverables: An EDA report with visualizations and insights.



Deliverables

Descriptive Statistics Report



Summary statistics for numerical features, including mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.

Frequency distribution and mode for categorical features.

Insights into the central tendency, dispersion, and distribution of the data.

Visual Analysis Report



Histograms: Visual representation of the distribution of numerical features to identify patterns or skewness.

Pair Plots: Visualization of relationships between pairs of numerical features to identify correlations or trends.

Heatmaps: Correlation matrix heatmap to identify relationships between features and their potential relevance to the target variable.



Insights and Recommendations



Highlight significant findings from the statistical and visual analysis, such as highly correlated features or features with significant variability.

Provide actionable recommendations for data preprocessing, such as handling missing values, normalizing features, or balancing the dataset.
